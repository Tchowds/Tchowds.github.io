            <h3>Tetris autoplayer bot</h3>
            
            <p>Given the <i>python</i> code of a version of the game Tetris and the API behind how the game works, we were tasked to create a bot to autoplay a game of tetris and more importantly optimize it to achieve the highest score.</p>

            <p>Using <i>Java, Java servlets, Tomcat and Maven</i>, we were tasked with creating a simple notes web application to store simple text notes with the option of enabling notes for different types. Notes were to be stored locally on the machine with the application enabled to accomodate for this feature.</p>

            <h3>Quick Quotes android app </h3>

            
            <p>My first time making an android app using kotlin. I used this project as a way to demonstrate what I had learned in my time doing online courses teaching how to code in Kotlin. It is a very basic app that gives you a randomized quote from a famous person of your choosing. I hope to progress my kotlin skills in the future.</p>
            <p><b>Important details:</b> Completely independent project, made with the android framwork using kotlin, xml and json.</p>

            <h3>Virtual Thieves [Working title] (COMING SOON)</h3>

            <p>As a way of getting into Virtual Reality game development in an exponentially growing market, my friends and I have decided to make an expansive Virtual Reality game called <b>Virtual Thieves</b>, a narrative and visually focussed game centred around exposing a near future society dependant on a virtual world.</p>

            <p>The game is still in pre-development phase, and more updates will come soon with its own webpage.</p>
